# ü•∑ **Shinobi Prompt Engineering Workshop** ü•∑  
### *Mastering AI Hallucination Control with Advanced Prompting Techniques*  

Welcome, AI Shinobi! In this workshop, you will train in the **art of precision, skepticism, and stealth** to control AI-generated content and prevent hallucinations. Follow the structured activities below, and by the end, you will have mastered **three elite techniques** to refine AI responses.  

---  

## **ü•∑ Lab 1: The Art of Stealth ‚Äì Counterfactual & Reflexive Critique Prompting**  
### **Shinobi Technique: The Shadow Clone Interrogation**  

> *A true Shinobi never trusts the first answer they receive‚Äîthey send out shadow clones to challenge it and reveal the truth.*  

### **Objective:**  
Detect and refine AI-generated responses by questioning their accuracy and validity.  

### **Instructions:**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Stealthy Questioning:**  
   - Ask an AI (ChatGPT, OpenAI Playground, etc.) a **factual question** related to your field.  
   - Example: *"Summarize the main arguments of [historical event, scientific theory, or literature]."*  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Shadow Clone Challenge:**  
   - Ask follow-up counterfactuals to expose inconsistencies:  
     - *"If this claim were false, what evidence would contradict it?"*  
     - *"What would be the strongest counterargument?"*  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **The Shinobi‚Äôs Skepticism:**  
   - Instruct AI to **critique its own response**:  
     - *"Analyze your previous response for potential errors or missing data. What might be misleading?"*  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Final Attack ‚Äì Source Verification:**  
   - Compare AI‚Äôs answer with **trusted sources** and correct any hallucinations.  

üîç **Reflection:**  
- How did counterfactual prompting change the AI‚Äôs response?  
- What errors did you find?

## **ü•∑ Lab 2: The Shinobi‚Äôs Path ‚Äì Fact-Scaffolded & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
### **Shinobi Technique: The Scroll of Absolute Truth**  

> *A Shinobi retrieves sacred scrolls before acting‚Äîknowledge is their weapon.*  

### **Objective:**  
Force AI to work strictly within provided factual constraints, preventing hallucinations.  

### **Instructions:**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **The Shinobi Scroll Selection:**  
   - Gather **trusted academic sources** on a chosen topic.  
   - Example: *Peer-reviewed articles, historical texts, or official reports.*  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Forbidden Knowledge Trap:**  
   - Ask the AI a research question **without sources**, then compare it to a **source-based** response.  
   - Example: *"What are the ethical implications of AI in education?"*  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Fact-Scaffolded Infiltration:**  
   - Step-by-step refinement:  
     1. *"List three peer-reviewed sources on [topic]."*  
     2. *"Extract key claims from these sources."*  
     3. *"Summarize them with proper citations."*  
     4. *"Remove unsupported claims."*  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Shinobi Scroll Completion:**  
   - Adjust AI‚Äôs output so that **every statement aligns with verified sources**.  

üîç **Reflection:**  
- How did the AI‚Äôs response differ when sources were provided?  
- What unsupported claims did you identify?

## **ü•∑ Lab 3: The Duel of Minds ‚Äì Socratic & Semantic Contrast Prompting**  
### **Shinobi Technique: The Duel of the Grandmasters**  

> *A Shinobi sharpens their mind through relentless questioning, uncovering deception through disciplined interrogation.*  

### **Objective:**  
Expose AI inconsistencies through deep questioning and comparative reasoning.  

### **Instructions:**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Shinobi Grandmaster‚Äôs First Strike:**  
   - Ask a **broad but researchable question**.  
   - Example: *"How did the Industrial Revolution impact global trade?"*  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **The Five Blades of Inquiry (Socratic Prompting):**  
   - Refine the question in **five steps**:  
     1. *"Explain this in the simplest terms."*  
     2. *"How does this relate to [another relevant topic]?"*  
     3. *"What are the strongest counterarguments?"*  
     4. *"Provide specific historical examples."*  
     5. *"What are the ethical implications?"*  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Semantic Contrast Sparring:**  
   - Ask AI to generate **two opposing interpretations** of the same data.  
   - Example:  
     - *"Provide both a positive and negative perspective on automation in the workforce."*  
     - *"Compare the views of historians A and B on this topic."*  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Grandmaster‚Äôs Final Strike ‚Äì Choosing the Strongest Argument:**  
   - Evaluate **which AI-generated interpretation is better supported by evidence**.  
   - Add **citations, historical perspectives, or scholarly references**.  

üîç **Reflection:**  
- Did AI struggle to produce meaningful counterarguments?  
- Which version of the AI response was most factually sound?

## **ü•∑ Final Mastery Challenge: The AI Shinobi Black Belt Test**  

### **Objective:**  
- Use all three techniques to analyze an AI-generated hallucinated article.  
- Deconstruct the false information using stealth, skepticism, and precision.  

### **Instructions:**  
1. **Find an AI-generated article with hallucinations.**  
2. **Identify unsupported claims.**  
3. **Apply all Shinobi techniques to refine and correct it.**  
4. **Submit your revised version.**
